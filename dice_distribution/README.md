# Modeling dice sum distribution

Given a number of fair dice, each having a given a number of facets, model the frenquency distribution of the dice sum.

## Data structure

The implementation uses Pascal's triangles to perform the calculation of the combinations of a given number of dice `n`  based on the number of combination from `n-1` dice.
